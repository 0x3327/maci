# El Gamal Flow (Anonymity in MACI)

## Introduction

This document describes the process of voting in MACI protocol with the attention to changes made to obtain voter's anonymity. This document focuses on the technical implementation of the changes to the protocol. For a more mathematical description of the key concepts, see [El Gamal general](elgamal-general.md) document.

MACI now utilizes El Gamal encryption along with rerandomization to enable key deactivation and generation of new keys without visible connection to the previously deactivated key. Using this protocol upgrade, full anonymity of the voters and their votes is obtained.

## Updates

Two new messages are being added: `deactivateKey` and `generateNewKey`.
A new tree is added which represents the tree of deactivated keys.

## Process

The upgraded (user) process looks like this:

1. User’s registration (signUp). This occurs initially (one time) when the user registers their public key.
2. Public key deactivation. There is a deactivation period within which the user can deactivate their current public key.
3. New key generation. The user registers a new public key based on the old, deactivated one.
4. Voting. The user casts a vote by publishing a message containing their new public key.

## Signup

`signUp` in [signUp.ts](../cli/ts/signUp.ts).

CLI’s `signUp` method calls the `signUp` function on the `MACI.sol` contract, and logs retrieved `stateIndex`.
The user sends their public key (two coordinates of the elliptic curve) which is registered in the state tree (new leaf enqueue). Aside from the public key it contains the number of vote credits of a user.

Contract's `signUp` function creates `StateLeaf` that contains the user’s `pubKey`, `voteCredits`, and registration `timestamp`. It hashes `StateLeaf` using the *Poseidon* hash function where elements of the array are $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the `pubKey`, and the aforementioned `voteCredits` and `timestamp`.

## Public Key Deactivation using El Gamal encryption

The user’s public key deactivation takes the following steps.

### Step 1: The user submits `deactivateKey` message

`deactivateKey` function in [deactivateKey.ts](../cli/ts/deactivateKey.ts).

The command being encrypted here takes the arguments:

- `stateIndex`: State leaf index
- `userMaciPubKey`: Hardcoded for key deactivation

```javascript
const userMaciPubKey = new PubKey([BigInt(0), BigInt(0)])
```

- `voteOptionIndex`: Set to 0 for key deactivation
- `newVoteWeight`: Set to 0 for key deactivation
- `nonce`
- `pollId`: Id of the poll to which the key deactivation relates
- `salt`

The reason `userMaciPubKey` is hardcoded in this message is that the command that forms the key deactivation message (`PCommand`), and the circom circuit that processes the messages are the same as in other messages (like publishing a vote or swapping a key), and when sent, it is added to the same message tree (`MessageAq`). Assigning (0, 0) to the `userMaciPubKey` parameter, along with setting `voteOptionIndex` and `newVoteWeight` to 0 effectively identifies these types of messages in the message tree (along with other parameters of the command).

The command is signed with the user’s MACI private key and encrypted using a generated ECDH shared key (see [shared key generation](primitives.md#shared-key-generation)).

The message is sent to the `Poll` contract along with the ephemeral public key so that the coordinator can get to the same shared key and decrypt the message.

```javascript
tx = await pollContractEthers.deactivateKey(
    message.asContractParam(),
    encKeypair.pubKey.asContractParam(),
    { gasLimit: 10000000 },
)
```

### Step 2: Attempt key deactivation

In the `Poll` smart contract, within `deactivateKey()` function, the received message is hashed and the new leaf is added to the message tree.

```solidity
uint256 messageLeaf = hashMessageAndEncPubKey(
    _message,
    _encPubKey
);

extContracts.messageAq.enqueue(messageLeaf);
```

Additionally, we store the incremental hash of each new deactivation message (chain hash update). Pseudocode:

```javascript
// ​​Message1
H1 = hash(H0, hash(M1));

// Message2
H2 = hash(H1, hash(M2));

//...
```

Actual code:

```solidity
deactivationChainHash = hash2([deactivationChainHash, messageLeaf]);
```

Since the deactivation period is different from the voting period, and in order to process deactivation messages, a merge of the message tree needs to be done. This can compromise the merging of the tree upon voting completion. This is why we store this hash of the deactivation messages that is later used to prove the correctness of message processing.

`PublishMessage` and `AttemptKeyDeactivation` events are emitted.

### Step 3: Coordinator confirms deactivation

`confirmDeactivation` in [confirmDeactivation.ts](../cli/ts/confirmDeactivation.ts).

<!-- Does he wait for the deactivation period or reacts immediately? He waits the period to expire in completeDeactivation function... -->
The coordinator waits for the deactivation period to expire upon which he collects all `AttemptKeyDeactivation` events and starts to process the deactivation messages, in batches.

He reconstructs the MACI state using `genMaciStateFromContract()` function which merges the state tree.

He then calls the `processDeactivationMessages()` function of the [MaciState.ts](../core/ts/MaciState.ts).
Here, for all deactivation messages, the following important things are happening:

- Verification of the deactivation message

It verifies the signature, `pubKey` set to `(0,0)`, `voteOptionIndex` and `newVoteWeight` set to 0, etc. This verification renders the status of deactivation.

- El Gamal encryption of the status

The deactivation status is encrypted using El Gamal encryption where `[c1, c2]` are ciphertexts of deactivation status:

```javascript
const [c1, c2] = elGamalEncryptBit(
    this.coordinatorKeypair.pubKey.rawPubKey,
    status ? BigInt(1) : BigInt(0),
    mask,
)
```

For details on this encryption, see [El Gamal Encryption](#el-gamal-encryption) section below.

- Construction of deactivated-keys tree leaf:

```javascript
const deactivatedLeaf = (new DeactivatedKeyLeaf(
    pubKey,
    c1,
    c2,
    salt,
)).hash()
```

`processDeactivationMessages()` function returns the deactivated-keys tree leaves along with circuit inputs used for generating proof of correct processing (explained in the next step).

The coordinator then submits all deactivated-keys tree leaves in batches to the `MessageProcessor` smart contract (`confirmDeactivation()` function). On the smart contract, these leaves are added to the deactivated-keys tree:

```solidity
extContracts.deactivatedKeysAq.insertSubTree(_subRoot);
```

`DeactivateKey` event is emitted:

```solidity
emit DeactivateKey(_subRoot);
```

### Step 4: Complete deactivation

`completeDeactivation` in [completeDeactivation.ts](../cli/ts/completeDeactivation.ts).

In `completeDeactivation()` function, again, the MACI state is reconstructed and `processDeactivationMessages()` is called to obtain `circuitInputs`.These inputs are required for [processDeactivationMessages.circom](../circuits/circom/processDeactivationMessages.circom) to generate proof of correct processing of deactivation messages.

The coordinator first calls the `mergeForDeactivation()` function of the `MessageProcessor` where the merge of deactivated-keys tree is happening:

```solidity
deactivatedKeysAq.mergeSubRoots(_deactivatedKeysNumSrQueueOps);
deactivatedKeysAq.merge(messageTreeDepth);
```

He then submits the generated proof to the `completeDeactivation()` function of the `MessageProcessor` smart contract where the verification of the submitted proof is happening.

The verification (partly) relies on the incremental hashing of the (incoming) deactivation messages (deactivation chain hash) - proves the hash of the final message he provided is equal to the stored hash.

```solidity
uint256 input = genProcessDeactivationMessagesPublicInputHash(
    deactivatedKeysAq.getMainRoot(messageTreeSubDepth),
    numSignUps,
    maci.getStateAqRoot(),
    poll.deactivationChainHash()
);

require(verifier.verify(_proof, vk, input), "Verification failed");
```

### El Gamal Encryption

`elGamalEncryptBit` in [index.ts](../crypto/ts/index.ts).

The encryption is performed within the crypto project, by utilizing the `elGamalEncryptBit` function. This function takes as inputs:

- `pubKey`: coordinator’s public key
- `bit`: the status of key deactivation that is being encrypted
- `y`: arbitrary value from the interval $(1,p)$ where $p$ is a prime number ($p=$ 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617)

Firstly, the bit is mapped to a point on the elliptic curve.

**Important improvement**: Since we only work with two possible values for this bit (deactivation status), we don’t need to rely on the hash-to-curve method, where for any value that needs to be mapped to a curve we need to perform a calculation. We can identify two points that we know for sure exist on the elliptic curve and use these two points to represent the input bit. These two points are

1. point at infinity
2. generator point ($G$)

As long as we have a finite number of statuses (bits) we want to represent on the elliptic curve, we can utilize these two points, where, for example, the next point would be $2G$. This reduces computation time.

The mapping of the bit to a point on the elliptic curve takes place in a `bitToCurve` function, where the bit is mapped to one of the two points, as explained above.

When the point on the elliptic curve that represents the bit is obtained, the `elGamalEncrypt` function is invoked which takes the following inputs:

- `pubKey`: coordinator’s public key
- `m`: a point on the elliptic curve (point at infinity or generator point)
- `y`: arbitrary value from the interval $(1,p)$ where $p$ is a prime number

This function returns `CipherText` in the form of `[c1, c2]` which represents the encrypted deactivation status. It is calculated as follows:

1. Multiply the generator point ($G$) with the randomness parameter ($y$). This represents $c1$.
2. Multiply $pubKey$ with the randomness parameter ($y$). This is stored as $s$.
3. Add a point on the elliptic curve received as the input ($m$) to the value from the previous step ($s$). This represents $c2$.

For more information, see [El Gamal general](elgamal-general.md) document.

For the generation of ZK proofs, there exists an equivalent circom circuit that takes care of the El Gamal Encryption: [elGamalEncryption.circom](../circuits/circom/elGamalEncryption.circom).
The coordinator proves through this ZK circuit that he encrypted the status correctly.

## New Key Generation

`generateNewKey` in [generateNewKey.ts](../cli/ts/generateNewKey.ts).

A new message type is added (type 3). This command is invoke by the user.

In `generateNewKey()` function, the user needs to provide his old and new public-private key pair.

The MACI state is reconstructed using `genMaciStateFromContract()` function which fetches the events and state from the smart contracts and replays them in the local maci state to reconstruct it.

From the reconstructed MACI state, `generateCircuitInputsForGenerateNewKey()` is called which takes the following arguments:

- `userMaciNewPubKey`
- `userMaciOldPrivKey`
- `userMaciOldPubKey`
- `coordinatorPubKey`
- `stateIndex`
- `newCreditBalance`
- `salt`
- `pollId`

At this point, function `generateCircuitInputsForGenerateNewKey` from [MaciState](../core/ts/MaciState.ts) has access to the `deactivatedKeyEvents` array, loaded with key-deactivation events.
It finds `deactivatedKeyIndex` from this array based on the hash of the user's deactivated public key and salt:

```javascript
const deactivatedKeyHash = hash3([...deactivatedPublicKey.asArray(), salt]);
const deactivatedKeyIndex = this.deactivatedKeyEvents.findIndex(d => d.keyHash === deactivatedKeyHash);
```

Key-deactivation event related to this user is then extracted from the `deactivatedKeyEvents` array based on the obtained index.

Next, two things are happening:

1. Deactivation status `c1` and `c2` is rerandomized (see [Rerandomization](#rerandomization) for detailed explanation):

```javascript
const [c1r, c2r] = elGamalRerandomize(
    newPublicKey.rawPubKey,
    z,
    deactivatedKeyEvent.c1,
    deactivatedKeyEvent.c2,
);
```

2. The nullifier is generated based on the user's old private key (see [Nullifiers](#nullifiers) for more details):

```javascript
const nullifier = hash2([BigInt(deactivatedPrivateKey.asCircuitInputs()), salt]);
```

Using `nullifier`, rerandomized deactivation status (`c1r`, `c2r`) and user's `newPubKey`, the key generation command (`KCommand`) is created.

Lastly, the circuit inputs are prepared which contain `deactivatedKeyIndex`, deactivation status (`c1`, `c2`) obtained from the deactivation event, and `deactivatedPrivateKey` among other parameters.

Circuit inputs and the encrypted command (the message) are then returned from `generateCircuitInputsForGenerateNewKey`.

Then, if the proof is valid, the message and the generated proof, along with other parameters, are sent to the `generateNewKeyFromDeactivated` function on the MessageProcessor smart contract:

```javascript
tx = await mpContract.generateNewKeyFromDeactivated(
    message.asContractParam(),
    coordinatorKeypair.pubKey.asContractParam(),
    encPubKey.asContractParam(),
    pollContract.address,
    formattedProof
)
```

On the smart contract, the input hash is generated based on the root hash of deactivated-keys tree, hash of the sent message, and other parameters:

```solidity
uint256 input = genGenerateNewKeyFromDeactivatedPublicInputHash(
    maci.getStateAqRoot(),
    deactivatedKeysAq.getMainRoot(DEACT_TREE_DEPTH),
    hashMessageData(_message),
    _coordPubKey,
    _encPubKey
);
```

This input is verified against the `_proof` provided to this smart contract function. If it passes, the function `generateNewKeyFromDeactivated` on the Poll smart contract is called.

*Note: generateNewKeyFromDeactivated function is divided into two parts in MessageProcessor and Poll smart contracts due to the size limitation.*

This function on the Poll smart contract only adds the message to the message tree - the message leaf, hash of the message and ECDH public key:

```solidity
_message.msgType = 3;
uint256 messageLeaf = hashMessageAndEncPubKey(_message, _encPubKey);
extContracts.messageAq.enqueue(messageLeaf);
```

In the end, `AttemptKeyGeneration` event is emitted and `newStateIndex` are returned.

### Rerandomization

`elGamalRerandomize` in [index.ts](../crypto/ts/index.ts).

Rerandomization is used because we want to use the encrypted message twice but without the message being able to be linked to the user's private key.
Specifically, on confirming deactivation, the `elGamalEncryptedMessage` can be connected to the user’s public key. Since the user needs to provide the key deactivation status (encrypted) when generating a new key, this encrypted message must not be the same as the one created when the user was submitting the key to deactivation.

The user needs to prove that encrypted deactivation status `[c1, c2]` exists in the deactivated-keys tree, but publicly releases a rerandomized version of this status, [c1’, c2’].

That function randomizes an existing cipher text (`[c1, c2]`) such that it’s still decryptable using the original public key it was encrypted for (`coordinatorPubKey`).

For the generation of ZK proofs, there exists an equivalent circom circuit that takes care of the rerandomization: [elGamalRerandomize.circom](../circuits/circom/elGamalRerandomize.circom).

Rerandomization function takes as inputs:

- `z`: arbitrary value from the interval $(1,p)$ where $p$ is a prime number
- `pubKey`: coordinator's public key
- `[c1, c2]`: `CipherText` that represents the encrypted deactivation status

This function returns `CipherText` in the form of `[c1’, c2’]` that represents the rerandomized encrypted deactivation status. It is calculated as follows:

1. Multiply generator point ($G$) with the randomness parameter ($z$) and add $c1$. This represents `c1`.
2. Multiply $pubKey$ with the randomness parameter ($z$) and add $c2$. This represents `c2’`.

### Nullifiers

In order not to be able to create a new key multiple times based on the old, deactivated one, the user must also send a nullifier in the message, which is a hash of the old private key:

```javascript
const nullifier = hash2([BigInt(deactivatedPrivateKey.asCircuitInputs()), salt]);
```

Nullifier is passed in the generate-key message (message type 3) which is verified by the coordinator when processing key-generation messages.

Nullifiers are stored in a sparse merkle tree and the coordinator checks whether the passed nullifier has already been seen - if so, he rejects it (non-inclusion proof).

## Voting

`publish` in [publish.ts](../cli/ts/publish.ts).

On voting action, the message is published.

The user signs the command with their private key and encrypts the command by passing their signature and ECDH shared key.

When the message is sent, it triggers a `publishMessage()` function on the `Poll` smart contract. The message is recorded in the message tree.

It hashes the message and public using the *Poseidon* hash function and adds the leaf to the message tree.

Upon the voting completion, the coordinator collects the root hash of the state tree and message tree ([mergeSignups.ts](../cli/ts/mergeSignups.ts) and [mergeMessages.ts](../cli/ts/mergeMessages.ts)) and processes messages one at a time, in batches.

They call the `Poll` smart contract functions:

- `mergeMaciStateAqSubRoots()` and `mergeMaciStateAq()` for the state tree
- `mergeMessageAqSubRoots()` and `mergeMessageAq()` for the message tree

These functions call the accumulator queue (`AccQueue.sol`) that exposes two functions: `mergeSubRoots()` and `merge()` which calculates the merkle root of all the leaves.

The coordinator provides a ZK proof that the messages are processed correctly and that the intermediary state is an input for the next step (batch).
The coordinator collects events that are emitted when the message is published and reconstructs them, collects root hashes of state and message trees, processes them in batches, and outputs the result (along with the proof) - the result is the tally of the votes.

In [genProofs.ts](../cli/ts/genProofs.ts) the MACI state is reconstructed (`genMaciStateFromContract()`), messages are processed, and proofs are generated and stored in a proof_file.
Then, in [proveOnChain.ts](../cli/ts/proveOnChain.ts) the coordinator sumbits proofs (saved proof_file) and commitment (the new state root and ballot root commitment after all messages are processed) from the previous step by calling `processMessages()` from `MessageProcessor.sol` and `tallyVotes()` from `TallyVotes.sol`.
