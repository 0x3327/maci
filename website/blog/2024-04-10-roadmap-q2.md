Greetings anons,

Glad to have you here. We have a few MACI roadmap updates to share.

Before we hop into our Q2 plans, let's take a look at Q1:

## Q1 in review

In Q1 we aimed at [a few major goals](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/discussions/859#discussioncomment-7849385) that all tied together:

### âœ… Release MACI v1.2

We completed a significant refactor to simplify the codebase and improve developer experience. After an internal audit, revamped documentation and educational resources, we released a new MACI version the world - see our [MACI v1.2 release post](/blog/maci-v1-2-0-release) to read up on all the benefits of that upgrade.

### âœ… clr.fund upgrade

[clr.fund](https://clr.fund/#/), a quadratic funding (QF) project which has distributed millions of dollars to Ethereum public goods, is the longest-running production application built on MACI (since 2020!). Thanks primarily to the hard work of their core dev [yuetloo](https://github.com/yuetloo), clr.fund successfully upgraded from 0.x to our fresh v1.2 release. Nicely done!

### âœ… ETH Latam QF round

What better way to celebrate the annual Ethereum conference of Latam than with a QF round? We teamed up with [ETH Latam](https://ethlatam.org/) to support their efforts to run a successful QF round on clr.fund with this latest version of MACI. Over 60 attendees participated (using [Zupass](https://zupass.org/) tickets as the faucet and round gatekeeper) to distribute over $30,000 DAI on Optimism to projects across Central America and the Carribean - [view the results here](https://qf.ethlatam.org/#/leaderboards/0x86F33909474c0dEf2Cb7F93d2eE0B8aF26112BF6/networks/optimism)!

### âœ… ETH Colombia QF round

Bonus points! Kudos also to the ETHColombia team who ran a [QF round for their community](https://www.ethcolombia.org/quadratic-funding-ethco-2024-q1) on the #RoadToETHLatam - [view the results here](https://qf.ethcolombia.org/#/leaderboards/0xa73Ec044b47186646D84D614b8a194dA3bE00260/networks/optimism)!

## Q2 Roadmap

Now let's look at what we're excited to build over the next few months:

### ðŸŽ¯ MACI-RPGF

[Retroactive Public Goods Funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) (RPGF) has been building momentum over the past few years and really took the crypto public goods funding space by storm after [Optimism's most recent round of 30 million OP](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-3/) in late 2023.

In February we [proposed MACI as a solution for Optimism's RPGF tech stack](https://gov.optimism.io/t/building-a-private-on-chain-implementation-for-retropgf/7733), thanks to MACI's strong guarantees of correct execution, censorship resistance, privacy, and collusion resistance. Since releasing a demo of our [full-stack MACI-RPGF implementation](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci-rpgf/) in March, we've received positive feedback and interest from various communities in running RPGF rounds on MACI.

This quarter we're excited to keep building out MACI-RPGF with additional functionality and improved UX. Our efforts will include supporting community organizers who want to fork and operate MACI-RPGF rounds in production. If you're interested in running a round for your community, [please get in touch](https://qf.pse.dev/apply)!

### ðŸŽ¯ MACI Coordinator Service

Speaking of UX improvements, from the [years of supporting QF rounds on MACI](https://qf.pse.dev/case-studies) we've learned a lot about the pain-points of community organizers running MACI rounds. The blunt truth is that many technical barriers to entry still exist - in order to operate a MACI poll (whether in a QF round or a simple voting application), you essentially need to be a developer to deploy smart contracts, execute on-chain transactions, and run tooling to generate zero-knowledge proofs to guarantee the integrity of a MACI poll. This is no trivial feat, and as a result, MACI is simply not a viable option for many projects today.

We're aiming to change this by kick-starting development of a "Coordinator Service" to simplify the role of the coordinator, automate tasks, and remove technical barriers to running MACI-RPGF (and all MACI) rounds. This will include a web interface to deploy and operate MACI instances as well as a server to generate proofs and submit them on-chain. We're confident this tooling will accelerate community adoption by offloading the technical overhead and domain knowledge currently required to use this technology stack.

More details to come on this soon.

## How does that sound?

Questions? Concerns? Ideas? Weâ€™d love to hear from you!

If there is a feature you think we should work on, or an initiative you'd like to collaborate with us on, please let us know! We welcome input from anyone in the community.

Onward and upward ðŸš€
