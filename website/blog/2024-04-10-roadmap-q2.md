Greetings anon,

Glad to have you here! We have a few MACI roadmap updates to share.

Before we hop into our Q2 plans, let's take a look at what we did in Q1:

## Q1 in review

In Q1 we aimed at [a few major goals](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/discussions/859#discussioncomment-7849385) that all tied together:

### ‚úÖ Release MACI v1.2

We completed a significant refactor to simplify the codebase and improve developer experience. After an internal audit, revamped documentation and educational resources, we released a new MACI version the world - see our [MACI v1.2 release post](/blog/maci-v1-2-0-release) to read up on all the benefits of that upgrade.

### ‚úÖ Support clr.fund upgrade

[clr.fund](https://clr.fund/#/), a quadratic funding (QF) project which has distributed millions of dollars to Ethereum public goods, is the longest-running production application built on MACI (since 2020!). Thanks primarily to the hard work of their core dev [yuetloo](https://github.com/yuetloo), clr.fund successfully upgraded from 0.x to our fresh v1.2 release. Nicely done!

### ‚úÖ Support ETH Latam QF round

What better way to celebrate the annual Ethereum conference of Latam than with a QF round? We teamed up with [ETH Latam](https://ethlatam.org/) to support their efforts to run a QF round using the clr.fund stack running on the latest version of MACI. Over 60 attendees participated (using [Zupass](https://zupass.org/) tickets as the gatekeeper to the faucet and round) to distribute over $30,000 DAI on Optimism to projects across Central America and the Carribean - [view the round results here](https://qf.ethlatam.org/#/leaderboards/0x86F33909474c0dEf2Cb7F93d2eE0B8aF26112BF6/networks/optimism) and learn more in [ETH Kipu's ETH Latam recap post](https://mirror.xyz/ethlatam.eth/OoDqW3Omy8NbOGosdDQ8XUp_fZjP4sf_s4VHkaPWZXM)!

### ‚úÖ Support ETH Colombia QF round

Kudos to the ETHColombia team who also ran a [QF round for their community](https://www.ethcolombia.org/quadratic-funding-ethco-2024-q1) on the [#RumboaETHLatam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RumboaETHLatam) - [view the round results here](https://qf.ethcolombia.org/#/leaderboards/0xa73Ec044b47186646D84D614b8a194dA3bE00260/networks/optimism)!

### ‚úÖ Community engagement via events

We participated in a series of hackathons

- ETHGlobal Circuit Breaker
- ETHGlobal London
- ETH Latam
- ETHDam
  Distributed a total of $XX in bounties

Spoke at conferences:

- Sam & Vee ETH Latam
- Sam Ethereum Lima
- Sam & Vee ETHDam
  It was amazing to engage with hackers and collaborators in the space.

## Q2 Roadmap

Now let's look at what we're excited to build over the next few months:

### üéØ MACI-RPGF

[Retroactive Public Goods Funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) (RPGF) has been building momentum over the past few years and really took the crypto public goods funding space by storm after [Optimism's most recent round of 30 million OP](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/retropgf-3/) in late 2023.

In February we [proposed MACI as a solution for Optimism's RPGF tech stack](https://gov.optimism.io/t/building-a-private-on-chain-implementation-for-retropgf/7733), thanks to MACI's strong guarantees of correct execution, censorship resistance, privacy, and collusion resistance. Since releasing a demo of our [full-stack MACI-RPGF implementation](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci-rpgf/) in March, we've received positive feedback and interest from various communities in running RPGF rounds on MACI.

This quarter we're excited to keep building out MACI-RPGF with additional functionality and improved UX. Our efforts will include supporting community organizers who want to fork and operate MACI-RPGF rounds in production. If you're interested in running a round for your community, [please get in touch](https://qf.pse.dev/apply)!

### üéØ MACI Coordinator Service

Speaking of UX improvements, from the [years of supporting QF rounds on MACI](https://qf.pse.dev/case-studies) we've learned a lot about the pain-points of community organizers running MACI rounds. The blunt truth is that many technical barriers to entry still exist - in order to operate a MACI poll (whether in a QF round or a simple voting application), you essentially need to be a developer to deploy smart contracts, execute on-chain transactions, and run tooling to generate zero-knowledge proofs to guarantee the integrity of a MACI poll. This is no trivial feat, and as a result, MACI is simply not a viable option for many projects today.

We're aiming to change this by kick-starting development of a "Coordinator Service" to simplify the role of the coordinator, automate tasks, and remove technical barriers to running MACI-RPGF (and all MACI) rounds. This will include a web interface to deploy and operate MACI instances as well as a server to generate proofs and submit them on-chain. We're confident this tooling will accelerate community adoption by offloading the technical overhead and domain knowledge currently required to use this technology stack.

More details to come on this soon.

### üéØ MACI Core Protocol Improvements

After a thorough refactor of MACI's code, which lead to the release of v1.2, we are now in position to integrate new features and improvements to the core protocol. As always, we are open to suggestions from the community, so if you have any ideas of a feature that should make it into MACI, please let us know!

Currently, we have a couple of ideas to focus on next:

**Unconditional Privacy**

As of now, MACI's [coordinator](/docs/workflow#coordinator) can track [user key changes](/docs/key-change), which allows them to associate voters with their respective votes, and thus collude with bribers to deanonymize users. We're looking into ways to prevent this possibility. The [3227](https://3327.io/) team implemented a [proof of concept](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/issues/796) for this, using El-Gamal to remove the link between a new MACI key and their original key. Furthermore, there is a proposal currently being discussed on how to implement anonymous poll signups, which would provide the same benefits of the El-Gamal protocol, though with a much better user experience.

**Deployment Improvements**

MACI's deployment process can certainly be made easier and more efficient. We will explore ways to improve this, for instance making it cheaper to deploy MACI by implementing patterns to only deploy contracts once if they can be reused across MACI instances. We aim to make it more user-friendly as well by providing a better interface to deploy MACI instances.

### üéØ Support Gitcoin Allo protocol integration

We mentioned in our [initial 2024 roadmap](/roadmap) that we intend to engage more with the broader Ethereum ecosystem in order to validate the value of MACI by exploring integrations and gathering input from community developers. Gitcoin is a great example: we've been in discussions with them to explore a MACI integration into their Allo protocol - the smart contracts that power Gitcoin Grants Stack - in order to increase user privacy and bribery resistance in their public good funding initiatives.

We're already in the process of supporting this integration, thanks to [Nick Lionis and Tse Lao and their ETHDam hackathon project](https://taikai.network/cryptocanal/hackathons/ethdam2024/projects/cluxse8cz00pjz3010wbq3thf/idea). We're excited to see this integration come to life in production and to support Gitcoin in their efforts to improve public goods funding on Ethereum!

### üéØ Support ETHDam hackathon QV round

Given the privacy focus of [ETHDam](https://www.ethdam.com/), we are excited to support a private QV round for the hackathon powered by MACI. Conference attendees will use clr.fund to vote on their favorite hackathon projects in order to allocate an additional $10,000 to hackathon projects building novel privacy and security solutions in the ecosystem. The round is live at [ethdamqf.com](http://ethdamqf.com/#/), so stay tuned for results!

### üéØ MACI starter kit

We're teaming up with Buidl Guild and the scaffold-eth dev community to build a MACI starter kit - a web app that integrates MACI. We expect this to be a useful resources for any developer prototyping on MACI or just looking for a simple reference implementation / prefer reading through code vs. documentation when trying to learn how to integrate MACI into a project / learn how to build a web application on top of MACI, or for any builder who merely wants to understand how the user flow works.

## How does that sound?

Questions? Concerns? Ideas? We‚Äôd love to hear from you!

If there is a feature you think we should work on, or an initiative you'd like to collaborate with us on, please let us know! We welcome input from anyone in the community.
